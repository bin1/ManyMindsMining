            <p class="literature">Many countries are facing an epidemic of obesity that can be explained, at least in part, by a sedentary life style and calorie overconsumption. This poses a major issue for public health since obesity primarily enhances the risk of various illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some cancers and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Consequently, obese patients are consuming on average more drugs than non-obese individuals [1]. This could pose another medical issue, in particular for hepatologists, since many drugs are able to induce liver injury [[2], [3]]. Moreover, there is growing evidence that obesity and NAFLD can increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), at least for some drugs [[3], [4]]. Thus, obese patients could be more prone to develop DILI as a consequence of drug overconsumption and an intrinsic susceptibility of their diseased liver to drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

            <p class="literature">
            Actually, DILI in obese patients could occur as two distinct clinical settings. Indeed, in the context of obesity and related metabolic diseases, some drugs seem to aggravate pre-existing NAFLD whereas others could induce more frequently an acute hepatitis (Fig. 1). Drugs that could aggravate NAFLD in obese patients are tamoxifen, irinotecan, methotrexate and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as stavudine and didanosine (Table 1 in Fig. 1) [[3], [5], [6], [7]]. Aggravation of NAFLD has also been documented in different animal models with rosiglitazone, tetracycline, phenobarbital and pentoxifylline (Table 1 in Fig. 1) [[3], [8]]. Drugs that could induce acute liver injury more often in obese individuals are the volatile halogenated anesthetic halothane and isoflurane, acetaminophen (APAP), and other drugs such as losartan, ticlopidine and omeprazole (Table 1 in Fig. 1) [[3], [9], [10], [11]]. However, it is noteworthy that the list of drugs in Table 1 is temporary and should expand in the future as DILI in the context of obesity is gaining growing attention. In this “Snapshot” article, I will put forward several potential mechanisms whereby drugs can be more hepatotoxic in obese individuals. Since these mechanisms have mostly been discovered during experimental studies, any extrapolation to humans should be done with caution.
