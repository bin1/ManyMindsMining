ManyMindsMining
===============
In data mining, machine learning algorithms for the numerical data normally works pretty well without human intervention. However, when mining data involves images (like image/figures in scholarly publication) and natural language, we still need input of human intelligence.

ManyMindsMining is a prototype implements the Find-Fix-Verify crowdsourcing algorithm in order to combine AI with human intelegence.
